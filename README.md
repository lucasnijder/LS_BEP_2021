Dear reader,

First of all, thank you for your interest in this study. 

Before anything can be executed, you first have to run the file "setup.R". This file loads the required packages and functions from the other files. 

----- SIMULATION -----
To get the results of the simulation, you navigate to the folder "simulation" and run the file "run_simulation.R".
Note that the default is PCA, this can be changed by changing 'pca' in line 11
The results for all methods are then collected in multiple csv files.

Once both PCA and SPCA have been simulated, the results can be visualized.
The tables can be recreated by running the file "results_table.R"
The barcharts can be recreated by running the file "number_of_retained_components.R"
(Note that redundant barcharts are created, these can be ignored)

----- EXAMPLES -----
The examples can be recreated by running the files in the "examples" folder.

----- RUN TIME PLOTS -----
The run time plots can be recreated by running the files in the "run_time_plots" folder.
